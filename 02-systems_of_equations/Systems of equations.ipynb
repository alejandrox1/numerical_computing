    "### Elimination step\n",
    "To carry out this step, we need to put zeros in the lower triangular area of the augmented matrix - use row operations to put a zero in each location below the diagonal.\n",
    "The locations below the main diagonal for a given column $j$ are then given by $a_{j+1,j}, a_{j+2,j},...,a_{nj}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to eliminate column 1, we need to put zeros in $a_{21}, a_{31},...,a_{n1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure will be as follows:\n",
    "1. We are looking to get an upper triangular matrix; we want to eliminate the entries below the diagonal for all columns except the last one (duh). So we iterate up to the next to last column.\n",
    "2. For a given column $j$, we will try and zero out all entries below the diagonal, that is, all $a_{j+1, j}$'s.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for j in range(n-1):\n",
    "    for i in range(j+1, n):\n",
    "        eliminate a[i,j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This begs the question, how do we actually eliminate any entries?\n",
    "Well, if we wanted to eliminate entry $a_{21}$ we could subtract $a_{21}/a_{11}$ times row 1 from row 2 - just as we did in our first example - assuming the entry right above is not zero. In this case, $a_{11} \\ne 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done, we choose $a_{22}$ as our next pivot and proceed accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate through the columns, from $j = 0,..,n-1$.\n",
    "2. Look for the elements below the main diagonal, $[j+1, n)$.\n",
    "3. Perform the elimination by subtracting the product of $a_{j+1, j}/a_{j, j}$ (the ratio of the first entry we are trying to eliminate in a given row and the entry right above it) and the entry in the row right above from the current spot - this boils down to subtracting the weighted entries from the row above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for j in range(n-1):                        # for all columns up to the rightmost column\n",
    "    ASSERT(abs(a[j,j]) > eps)               # proceed if pivot is greater than some mun value\n",
    "   \n",
    "    for i in range(j+1, n):                 # for each entry below the diagonal in column j\n",
    "        mult = a[i,j] / a[j,j]              # multiplying factor, divide entry by pivot\n",
    "        for k in range(j+1, n):             # for all entries in the given row\n",
    "            a[i,k] = a[i,k] - mult * a[j,k] \n",
    "        b[i] = b[i] - mult * b[j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If $k$ ranged from $j$ to $n$ then we would put a zero in the $a_{ij}$ (the pivot) location.\n",
    "Though since we will never look back at this entry then this step is simply ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to get rid of one entry we carry out 1 division, n multiplications, and n additions -> $2n + 1$ operations.\n",
    "Putting zeros in the first column would then require $n-1$ of these $2n + 1$ operations; for the second column we would need $n-2$ $2(n-1)+1$ operations, all the way up to the next to last column for a total of $2(2) + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some math, the total cost for the elimination step of a system of $n$ equations and $n$ variables an be completed in $\\frac{2}{3}n^3 + \\frac{1}{2}n^2 - \\frac{7}{6}n$."
